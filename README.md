# The Solar System (React)

## Overview
This app works the same as the previous one, but using Reacts library and framework. You can navigate through the Solar System with the hamburger menu (top right side). I intergrated a outside database (same API as last project) with more useful, and information.

## MVP
This App is built with React, and Flexbox CSS for design. It has three responsive design (Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile). Used an API to gather information about the planets.

## Post MVP 
I would like to implement more design using animation from CSS, and intergrate a slider, and modal pattern on the app.
